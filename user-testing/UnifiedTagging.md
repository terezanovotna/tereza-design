# Unified Tagging - Summit 2018 Testing


 ## Introduction:
Thank you for participating today. We are conducting research on a new UI component that allows users to narrow down a data set they’re viewing. Throughout this study, we’ll be giving you a few tasks. While you’re working, please tell me what you’re thinking, describe the steps you’re taking, what you expect to see, and why you’re doing things. It’s important that you’re open and honest with your feedback.

First I’d like to gather some basic info about you:

1. Job / Role / Occupation
2. Company
3. Years of experience
4. Red Hat products used

## Interview

5. Do you use tagging in your enterprise IT applications?
  * Yes / No
6. Can you think of other use cases when you use tagging?
7. How does tagging things in the application help you?
8. Can you follow up on that?
  * We want to make sure we understand why people actually tag things
9. What is the purpose of tagging?

Now we’ll start the test! We will start on an interface where the user has selected one VM. I’ll give you a scenario, then you’ll click on the prototype on the screen to accomplish a task. This is a prototype, so some areas will not be clickable - if you click on something that doesn’t respond, please let me know and tell me what you expected to happen. Any questions?

## Task 1
*Imagine you are an administrator and you’re in the process of interacting with one VM and you want to assign it a tag. That tag will be for the Development environment , so you want the tag to reflect those attributes. Use the prototype to do this.*
